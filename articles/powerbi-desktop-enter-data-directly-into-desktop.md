# Enter data directly into Power BI Desktop

With Power BI Desktop, you can enter data directly and use that data in your reports and visualizations. For example, you can copy portions of a workbook or web page, then paste it into Power BI Desktop.

To enter data directly, select <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Enter Data<ept id="p1">**</ept> from the <bpt id="p2">**</bpt>Home<ept id="p2">**</ept> ribbon.

Power BI Desktop may attempt to make minor transformations on the data, if appropriate, just like it does when you load data from any source. For example, in the following case it promoted the first row of data to headers.

If you want to shape the data you entered (or pasted), you can select the Edit button to bring up <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Query Editor<ept id="p1">**</ept>, where you can shape and transform the data before bringing it into Power BI Desktop. Or you can select the <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Load<ept id="p1">**</ept> button to import the data as it appears.

When you select <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Load<ept id="p1">**</ept>, Power BI Desktop creates a new table from your data, and makes it available in the <bpt id="p2">**</bpt>Fields<ept id="p2">**</ept> pane. In the following image, Power BI Desktop shows my new table, called <bpt id="p1">*</bpt>Table1<ept id="p1">*</ept> by default, and the two fields within that table that were created.

And that’s it – it’s that easy to enter data into Power BI Desktop.

You’re now ready to use the data in Power BI Desktop to create visuals, reports, or interact with any other data you might want to connect with and import, such as Excel workbooks, databases, or any other data source.
