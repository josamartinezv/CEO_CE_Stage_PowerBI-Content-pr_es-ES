# Tutorial: slicers in Power BI  

Your VP of Sales wants to be able to look at a number of metrics, for the entire division and for each individual District Manager. She could create a separate report page for each manager, or she could use a slicer. A slicer narrows the portion of the dataset shown in the other visualizations on the page.  Slicers are an alternate way of filtering.

## When to use a slicer  
Slicers are a great choice in the following situations.

-   To display commonly-used or important filters on the report canvas for easier access.

-   To make it easier to see the current filtered state without having to open a drop-down list to find the filtering details.

- When you want to hide columns you don't need but still be able to use them to filter - this makes for narrower, cleaner tables.

- To create more focused reports - since slicers are floating objects you can put them next to the interesting part of the report you want your users to focus on.

## Create a slicer

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7rrvpa6KUto" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

1.  Open the <bpt id="p1">[</bpt>Retail Analysis Sample<ept id="p1">](powerbi-sample-retail-analysis-take-a-tour)</ept> in <bpt id="p2">[</bpt>Editing View<ept id="p2">](powerbi-service-interact-with-a-report-in-editing-view.md)</ept> and <bpt id="p3">[</bpt>add a new report page<ept id="p3">](powerbi-service-add-a-page-to-a-report.md)</ept>.

2. From the Fields pane, select <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>District &gt; District Manager<ept id="p1">**</ept>.

3.  Convert the visualization to a slicer. In the Visualizations pane, select the slicer icon.

## Format the slicer

1. With the slicer selected, in the Visualizations pane, select the paint roller icon <ph id="ph1">![](media/powerbi-service-tutorial-slicers/power-bi-paintroller.png)</ph> to display the Format options.

2. Select <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>General &gt; Outline color<ept id="p1">**</ept> and choose dark blue and change the <bpt id="p2">**</bpt>Weight<ept id="p2">**</ept> to <bpt id="p3">**</bpt>6<ept id="p3">**</ept>.

    ![](media/powerbi-service-tutorial-slicers/PBI_slicer_outline2.png)

3. Under <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Selection Controls<ept id="p1">**</ept>, by default, <bpt id="p2">**</bpt>Select All<ept id="p2">**</ept> is <bpt id="p3">**</bpt>Off<ept id="p3">**</ept> and <bpt id="p4">**</bpt>Single Select<ept id="p4">**</ept> is <bpt id="p5">**</bpt>On<ept id="p5">**</ept>. This means that I have to use the CTRL key to select more than one name at a time. Turn <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Select All<ept id="p1">**</ept> to <bpt id="p2">**</bpt>On<ept id="p2">**</ept> and <bpt id="p3">**</bpt>Single Select<ept id="p3">**</ept> to <bpt id="p4">**</bpt>Off<ept id="p4">**</ept>.

    ![](media/powerbi-service-tutorial-slicers/PBI_slicer_selectionControls2.png)

  - Notice that the slicer now has a <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Select All<ept id="p1">**</ept> option at the top of the list. Toggle <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Select All<ept id="p1">**</ept> to select all of the names or to select none of the names.

  - And you can now select more than one name without having to use the CTRL key.

4. Under <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Items<ept id="p1">**</ept>, increase the text size to 14pt.  We want to be sure that our colleagues notice this slicer.

5. Lastly, set <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Font color<ept id="p1">**</ept> to a dark red.  This will distinguish the selected names from the unselected names in our slicer.

6. Have fun exploring the other options available for slicers.

## Use the slicer in a report

1. Add some additional visualizations to the report page or open the <bpt id="p1">[</bpt>Retail Analysis sample report<ept id="p1">](powerbi-sample-retail-analysis-take-a-tour.md)</ept> and select the <bpt id="p2">**</bpt>District Monthly Sales<ept id="p2">**</ept> tab.

2. Slice the report page for Carlos. Notice how the other visualizations update to reflect these selections.

    ![](media/powerbi-service-tutorial-slicers/slicer2.gif)

3. Sort the slicer alphabetically by District Manager last name.  Select the ellipses (...) in the top right corner of the slicer and choose <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>District Manager<ept id="p1">**</ept>.

## Control what effect the slicer has on other visuals on the page

Do you want the slicer to only filter some of the visuals on the report page?  Use the <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Visual interactions<ept id="p1">**</ept> control to set this up.

1. Select the slicer to make it active and, from the menu bar, choose <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Visual interactions<ept id="p1">**</ept>.

    ![](media/powerbi-service-tutorial-slicers/pbi-slicer-interactions.png)

2. Filter controls will appear above all the other visuals on the page. If the slicer should filter a visual, select the <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Filter<ept id="p1">**</ept> icon.  If the slicer should have no effect on the visual, select the <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>None<ept id="p1">**</ept> icon.

##  Limitations of slicers in Power BI
There are a few limitations to using slicers in Power BI, which are the following:
1.  Slicers do not support input fields.

2.  A single slicer cannot be used across an entire report. A slicer only impacts the current page.

3.  Slicers cannot be pinned to a dashboard.

4.  Drilldown is not supported for slicers.
