## What is Focus mode?  

<bpt id="p1">***</bpt>Focus<ept id="p1">***</ept> mode lets you expand (pop out) a dashboard tile or report visual to see more detail.  While in Focus mode for a dashboard tile, you can view and modify the filters that were applied when this visual was created.  And while in Focus mode for a report visual, you can view and modify the Visual level and Page level filters.

>[AZURE.NOTE] Currently, Focus mode is not available for tiles created from Q&amp;A or for map tiles. 

>[AZURE.NOTE]  &gt;Focus is different from full screen mode.  Full screen mode is available for <bpt id="p1">[</bpt>dashboards and reports <ept id="p1">](powerbi-service-dash-and-reports-fullscreen.md)</ept> and <bpt id="p2">[</bpt>tiles<ept id="p2">](powerbi-service-display-tile-in-full-screen-mode.md)</ept>.

1.  Hover over the tile or visual and select the <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Focus mode<ept id="p1">**</ept> icon <ph id="ph1">![](media/powerbi-service-display-tile-in-full-screen-mode/PBI_popOut.jpg)</ph>.

2.  It opens and fills the entire canvas.

4.  Explore further by modifying the filters and, if you discover something interesting, pin the visual to a dashboard.   

6.  Leave Focus mode and return to the dashboard by selecting the Focus mode icon (in the top left corner of the visual).
