If you are having problems signing up for Power BI with your work email address, one potential workaround is to sign up for an Office 365 trial first and then signing up for Power BI.  You will be able to use Power BI even after the Office 365 trial expires. 

> [AZURE.NOTE] You cannot use personal email addresses such as @live.com or @gmail.com with Office 365 or Power BI. For more information, see <bpt id="p1">[</bpt><ept id="p1">](powerbi-service-self-service-signup-for-power-bi.md#what-email-address-can-be-used-with-power-bi)</ept>.

1.  Sign up for an Office 365 trial <bpt id="p1">[</bpt>on the Office 365 web site<ept id="p1">](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=403802)</ept>.

2.  When you complete that signup process, you will be given a new sign in name that looks like you@yourcompany.onmicrosoft.com.  This will be the sign in name you will use for Power BI as well.

3.  Sign up for Power BI <bpt id="p1">[</bpt>using this link<ept id="p1">](https://portal.office.com/Start/Confirm?Sku=a403ebcc-fae0-4ca2-8c8c-7a907fd6c235&amp;ru=https%3A%2F%2Fapp.powerbi.com%3FredirectedFromSignup%3D1%26noSignUpCheck%3D1)</ept>.  If you are prompted, sign in using the sign in name and password you selected for Office 365 in Step 1.

    > [AZURE.NOTE] If you already sign into Power BI or Office 365 with an organization login, you may want to use an InPrivate browser session to log in with the new account you created.

4.  That's it!  When you're finished, you will be redirected to Power BI.

### Important Considerations

-   By using this signup method you are creating a new organizational tenant and you will become the administrator of the tenant.  Because sharing in Power BI is only allowed within a single tenant, you will not be able to share with users outside this tenant.  For example, if you create the tenant yourcompany.onmicrosoft.com in Step 2, you will not be able to share with users at yourcompany.com.  You can add new users to your tenant, then share with them, as described in <bpt id="p1">[</bpt>this help topic<ept id="p1">](https://support.office.com/en-sg/article/Add-users-individually-to-Office-365---Admin-Help-1970f7d6-03b5-442f-b385-5880b9c256ec?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-SG&amp;ad=SG)</ept>.
