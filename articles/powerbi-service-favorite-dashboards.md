# Favorite dashboards in Power BI

When you make a dashboard a <bpt id="p1">*</bpt>favorite<ept id="p1">*</ept>,  you'll be able to access it from all of your workspaces.  Favorite dashboards are typically those that you visit most often.

>[AZURE.NOTE] You can also select a single dashboard as a <bpt id="p1">[</bpt>Featured dashboard<ept id="p1">](powerbi-service-featured-dashboards.md)</ept> in Power BI.

## Add dashboards as "favorites"

1.  In the left navigation pane, select a dashboard.

2.  From the top-right corner, select <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Favorite<ept id="p1">**</ept>.
