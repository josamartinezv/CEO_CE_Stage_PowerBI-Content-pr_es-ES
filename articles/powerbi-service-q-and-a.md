# Q&amp;A in Power BI
## What is Q&amp;A?

Sometimes the fastest way to get an answer from your data, is to ask a question using natural language.  For example, "what were total sales last year."  Use Q&amp;A to explore your data using intuitive, natural language capabilities and receive answers in the form of charts and graphs. Q&amp;A is different from a search engine -- Q&amp;A only provides results about the data in Power BI.

Asking the question is just the beginning.  Have fun traveling through your data refining or expanding your question, uncovering trust-worthy new information, zeroing in on details and zooming out for a broader view. You’ll be delighted by the insights and discoveries you make.

The experience is truly interactive…and fast! Powered by an in-memory storage, response is almost instantaneous.
