# Pin an entire report page, as a live tile, to a Power BI dashboard

Another way to add a new <bpt id="p1">[</bpt>dashboard tile<ept id="p1">](powerbi-service-dashboard-tiles.md)</ept> is by pinning an entire report page.  This is an easy way to pin more than one visualization at a time.  Also, when you pin an entire page, the tiles are <bpt id="p1">*</bpt>live<ept id="p1">*</ept>; you can interact with them right there on the dashboard. And changes you make to any of the visualizations back in the report editor, like adding a filter or changing the fields used in the chart, are reflected in the dashboard tile as well.  

>[AZURE.NOTE]  You can't pin tiles from reports that are shared with you.

## Pin a report page

2.  Pin the tile to an existing dashboard or to a new dashboard. Notice the highlighted text: <bpt id="p1">*</bpt>Pin live page enables changes to reports to appear in the dashboard tile when the page is refreshed.<ept id="p1">*</ept>

  -   Existing dashboard: select the name of the dashboard from the dropdown. Dashboards that have been shared with you will not appear in the dropdown.

  -   New dashboard: type the name of the new dashboard.

3.  Select <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Pin live<ept id="p1">**</ept>. A Success message (near the top right corner) lets you know the page was added, as a tile, to your dashboard.

4.  From the navigation pane, select the dashboard with the new live tile. There, you can do things like <bpt id="p1">[</bpt>rename, resize, link, and move<ept id="p1">](powerbi-service-edit-a-tile-in-a-dashboard.md)</ept> the pinned report page.  

5. Interact with the live tile.  In the screenshot below, selecting a bar on the column chart has cross-filtered and cross-highlighted the other visualizations on the tile.
