## What is Power BI?
<bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Power BI<ept id="p1">**</ept> is a collection of software services, apps, and connectors that work together to turn your unrelated sources of data into coherent, visually immersive, and interactive insights. Whether your data is a simple Excel spreadsheet, or a collection of cloud-based and on-premises hybrid data warehouses, <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Power BI<ept id="p1">**</ept> lets you easily connect to your data sources, visualize (or discover) what’s important, and share that with anyone or everyone you want.

<bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Power BI<ept id="p1">**</ept> can be simple and fast – capable of creating quick insights from an Excel spreadsheet or a local database. But <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Power BI<ept id="p1">**</ept> is also robust and enterprise-grade, ready for extensive modeling and real-time analytics, as well as custom development. So it can be your personal report and visualization tool, and can also serve as the analytics and decision engine behind group projects, divisions, or entire corporations.

## The Parts of Power BI
Power BI consists of a Windows desktop application called <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Power BI Desktop<ept id="p1">**</ept>, an online SaaS (<bpt id="p2">*</bpt>Software as a Service<ept id="p2">*</ept>) service called the <bpt id="p3">**</bpt>Power BI service<ept id="p3">**</ept>, and mobile Power BI <bpt id="p4">**</bpt>apps<ept id="p4">**</ept> available on Windows phones and tablets, as well as for iOS and Android devices.

These three elements – the <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Desktop<ept id="p1">**</ept>, the <bpt id="p2">**</bpt>service<ept id="p2">**</ept>, and <bpt id="p3">**</bpt>Mobile<ept id="p3">**</ept> – are designed to let people create, share, and consume business insights in the way that serves them, or their role, most effectively.

## How Power BI matches your role
How you use Power BI may depend on your role in a project or on a team. And other people, in other roles, might use Power BI differently, which is just fine.

For example, you might primarily use the <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Power BI service<ept id="p1">**</ept>, but your number-crunching, business-report-creating coworker might make extensive use of <bpt id="p2">**</bpt>Power BI Desktop<ept id="p2">**</ept> (and publish Desktop reports to the Power BI service, which you then view). And another coworker, in sales, might mainly use her Power BI phone app to monitor progress on her sales quotas, and to drill into new sales lead details.

You also might use each element of <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Power BI<ept id="p1">**</ept> at different times, depending on what you’re trying to achieve or what your role is for a given project or effort.

Perhaps you view inventory and manufacturing progress in a real-time dashboard in the service, and also use <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Power BI Desktop<ept id="p1">**</ept> to create reports for your own team about customer engagement statistics. How you use Power BI can be based on which feature or service of Power BI is the best tool for your situation – but each part of Power BI is available to you, which is why it’s so flexible and compelling.

We discuss these three elements – the <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Desktop<ept id="p1">**</ept>, <bpt id="p2">**</bpt>service<ept id="p2">**</ept>, and <bpt id="p3">**</bpt>Mobile<ept id="p3">**</ept> apps – with more detail a little later in this <bpt id="p4">**</bpt>Guided Learning<ept id="p4">**</ept> course. We’ll also create reports in Power BI Desktop, share them in the service, and drill into them on our Mobile device in upcoming articles, too.

## The Flow of Work in Power BI
A common flow of work in Power BI begins in <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Power BI Desktop<ept id="p1">**</ept>, where a report is created. That report is then published to the Power BI <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>service<ept id="p1">**</ept>, and then shared so users of <bpt id="p2">**</bpt>Power BI Mobile<ept id="p2">**</ept> apps can consume the information.

It doesn’t always happen that way, and that’s okay, but we’ll use that flow to help you learn the various parts of Power BI, and how they complement one another.

Okay, now that we have an overview of this course, what Power BI is, and its three main elements, let's take a look at what using <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Power BI<ept id="p1">**</ept> is like.
