# Page display settings in a Power BI report

We understand it is critical to keep your report layout pixel perfect. Sometimes, it can be challenging, because you and your colleagues view those reports on screens with different aspect ratios and sizes. 

The default display view is <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Fit to page<ept id="p1">**</ept> and the default display size is <bpt id="p2">**</bpt>16:9<ept id="p2">**</ept>. If you want to lock in a different aspect ratio, or want to fit your report in a different way, there are two tools to help you: <bpt id="p1">***</bpt>Page View<ept id="p1">***</ept> settings and <bpt id="p2">***</bpt>Page Size<ept id="p2">***</ept> settings.

## Page View settings

![](media/powerbi-service-change-report-display-settings/pbi-change-page-view.png)



The <bpt id="p1">*</bpt>Page View<ept id="p1">*</ept> settings let you control the display of your report page relative to the browser window.  You can choose between:

-   <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Fit to Page<ept id="p1">**</ept> (default): contents are scaled to best fit the page
-   <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Fit to Width<ept id="p1">**</ept>: contents are scaled to fit within the width of the page
-   <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Actual Size<ept id="p1">**</ept>: contents are displayed at full size

Page View settings are available in both <bpt id="p1">[</bpt>Reading View<ept id="p1">](powerbi-service-interact-with-a-report-in-reading-view.md)</ept> and <bpt id="p2">[</bpt>Editing View<ept id="p2">](powerbi-service-interact-with-a-report-in-editing-view.md)</ept>. In Editing View, a report owner can assign a Page View setting to individual report pages, and those settings are saved with the report. When a colleague opens that report in Reading View, she sees the report pages display using the owner's settings.  However, while working with the report in Reading View, she can temporarily change the Page View settings.  Once she leaves the report, the Page View settings revert back to those that were set by the report owner.

## Page Size settings

The <bpt id="p1">*</bpt>Page Size<ept id="p1">*</ept> settings control the display ratio and actual size (in pixels).  Page Size settings are only available in Editing View.

-   4:3 ratio

-   16:9 ratio (default)

-   Cortana

-   Letter

-   Custom (height and width in pixels)
