# Get started with the Power BI app for iOS on an iPhone or iPod Touch

The Microsoft Power BI for iOS app, on the iPhone or iPod Touch, is part of the mobile BI experience for Power BI and Reporting Services. With live, touch-enabled mobile access to your important business information on premises and in the cloud, you can view and interact with your company dashboards easily, from anywhere. Explore the data in dashboards, and share them with your colleagues in email or text messages. And keep up to date with your most timely data on your <bpt id="p1">[</bpt>Apple Watch<ept id="p1">](powerbi-mobile-apple-watch.md)</ept>.

You <bpt id="p1">[</bpt>create dashboards and reports in the Power BI service<ept id="p1">](powerbi-service-get-started.md)</ept> with your data. 

Then interact with your dashboards and reports, explore the data, and share them, all from the iPhone app for Power BI.

You can also <bpt id="p1">[</bpt>view Reporting Services KPIs and mobile reports for your on-premises data<ept id="p1">](powerbi-mobile-ipad-kpis-mobile-reports.md)</ept> in the iPhone app for Power BI.
