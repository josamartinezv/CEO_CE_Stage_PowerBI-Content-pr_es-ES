# Dashboards in the iPhone app (Power BI for iOS)  

Dashboards are a portal to your company's life cycle. Learn how you can view, explore, and share your dashboards in the Power BI for iOS  app on the iPhone.  

You don't create dashboards in the Power BI app on your iPhone. You <bpt id="p1">[</bpt>create dashboards<ept id="p1">](powerbi-service-dashboards.md)</ept> or <bpt id="p2">[</bpt>connect to built-in dashboards for services<ept id="p2">](powerbi-content-packs-services.md)</ept> such as Salesforce in the Power BI service (<bpt id="p3">[</bpt>https://www.powerbi.com<ept id="p3">](https://www.powerbi.com)</ept>) on your computer.

Then in the iPhone app for Microsoft Power BI for iOS, you can explore these same dashboards. Dashboards refresh in real time, automatically, so you don't need to manually refresh them.

## View dashboards on your iPhone  
1.  Open the Power BI app on your iPhone and sign in.

3.  Tap a dashboard to open it.

    By default, Power BI dashboards look a little different on your iPhone. All the tiles appear the same size, and they're arranged one after another from top to bottom.
