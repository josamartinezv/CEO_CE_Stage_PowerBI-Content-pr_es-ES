## <a name="tips-and-troubleshooting"></a>Tips and troubleshooting

When you first open a sample workbook in Excel, you may see two warnings.

-   The first says the workbook is in Protected View. Select <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Enable Editing<ept id="p1">**</ept>.

-   The second says the workbook has external data connections. Select <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Enable Content<ept id="p1">**</ept>.

Each workbook contains several sheets:

-   The Info tab provides information about obviEnce, the company that created the sample.

-   The other tabs are Power View sheets with the report visuals. You may need to <bpt id="p1">[</bpt>enable the Power View add-in<ept id="p1">](https://support.office.com/article/Create-a-Power-View-sheet-in-Excel-2013-B23D768D-7586-47FE-97BD-89B80967A405#__toc328591957)</ept>.

The workbook contains the actual data, but it's in the data model, not in worksheets.

-   To see the data, on the <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>PowerPivot<ept id="p1">**</ept> tab, select <bpt id="p2">**</bpt>Manage Data Model<ept id="p2">**</ept>.
