# Save a report in Power BI

After you change a report in Power BI, you can save it, save it with a new name, or just close it without saving your changes. Say you open the report, create a visualization, and pin it to your dashboard. If you close it now without saving your changes, the tile remains on the dashboard, but the visualization isn't saved in the report. When you click that tile on the dashboard, the report opens, but the visualization is gone.

### To save a report:

1.  If the file name in the top navigation bar has an asterisk next to it, you know the report has changed.

    >[AZURE.NOTE] You cannot use Save As on a read-only report.

2.  Select <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>FILE<ept id="p1">**</ept> <ph id="ph1">\&gt;</ph> <bpt id="p2">**</bpt>Save<ept id="p2">**</ept> or <bpt id="p3">**</bpt>Save As<ept id="p3">**</ept>.

    If this is a new report, give it a descriptive name.  That name will appear under <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Reports<ept id="p1">**</ept> in the navigation pane.
