# <a name="share-a-dashboard-from-the-android-mobile-phone-app-for-power-bi"></a>Share a dashboard from the Android mobile phone app for Power BI

Invite colleagues to view your dashboards by sharing links from the <bpt id="p1">[</bpt>Android app for Microsoft Power BI<ept id="p1">](powerbi-mobile-android-app-get-started.md)</ept>. 

## <a name="share-a-dashboard"></a>Share a dashboard

1.  On the dashboards home page, tap the ellipsis (...) and tap <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Invite a colleague<ept id="p1">**</ept>.

    ![](media/powerbi-mobile-share-a-dashboard-from-the-android-app/power-bi-android-invite-dashboard-home.png)

2.  Or, in the upper-right corner of a dashboard, tap the invite icon <ph id="ph1">![](media/powerbi-mobile-share-a-dashboard-from-the-android-app/power-bi-android-invite-icon.png)</ph>.

 
    If you're the owner of the dashboard, you see the list of colleagues with whom you've shared this dashboard, with these notes:

    -   <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Can view<ept id="p1">**</ept>: They have viewed the dashboard but can't share it.

    -   <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Can view &amp; invite<ept id="p1">**</ept>: They have viewed the dashboard and can share it with other colleagues.

2.  Type email addresses, and a message to accompany your dashboard invitation. Otherwise Power BI sends a default message.

3.  To allow resharing, leave <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Allow recipients to share this dashboard<ept id="p1">**</ept> selected.

    ><bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Note<ept id="p1">**</ept>:  Resharing allows your coworkers to forward the email invitation to others in your organization, either through the browser or the mobile apps.

4.  Tap the airplane icon <ph id="ph1">![](media/powerbi-mobile-share-a-dashboard-from-the-android-app/PBI_Andr_SendPlane.png)</ph> in the upper-right corner to send the mail.

    Your colleagues get an email invitation with a direct link to the dashboard. The invitation expires after one month. When they open it in a browser or in one of the mobile apps, it's added to their Power BI account.

    ><bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Note<ept id="p1">**</ept>: Read more <bpt id="p2">[</bpt>notes about sharing dashboards with colleagues<ept id="p2">](powerbi-service-share-unshare-dashboard.md#notes-about-sharing)</ept>.

## <a name="unshare-a-dashboard"></a>Unshare a dashboard

Only the dashboard owner can unshare a dashboard.

1.  In the upper-right corner of your dashboard, tap the invite icon <ph id="ph1">![](media/powerbi-mobile-share-a-dashboard-from-the-android-app/power-bi-android-invite-icon.png)</ph>. 

    You see the list of colleagues with whom you've shared this dashboard.

2.   To stop sharing the dashboard with a colleague, tap the <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>X<ept id="p1">**</ept> next to a name <ph id="ph1">\&gt;</ph> <bpt id="p2">**</bpt>Remove<ept id="p2">**</ept>.
