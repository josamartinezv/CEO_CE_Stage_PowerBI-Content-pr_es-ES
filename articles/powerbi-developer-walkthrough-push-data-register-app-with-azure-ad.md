# Step 1: Register an app with Azure AD

This article is part of a step-by-step walkthrough to <bpt id="p1">[</bpt>push data into a dashboard<ept id="p1">](powerbi-developer-walkthrough-push-data.md)</ept>.

The first step to push data into a Power BI dashboard is to register your app in Azure AD. You need to do this first so that you have a <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Client ID<ept id="p1">**</ept> that identifies your app in Azure AD. Without a <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Client ID<ept id="p1">**</ept>, Azure AD cannot authenticate your app.

><bpt id="p1">**</bpt>NOTE<ept id="p1">**</ept>: Before you register an app for Power BI, you need to <bpt id="p2">[</bpt>Sign up for Power BI<ept id="p2">](powerbi-admin-free-with-custom-azure-directory.md)</ept>.

Here are the steps to register an app in Azure AD.

## Register an app in Azure AD

1. Go to dev.powerbi.com/apps.
2. Click <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Sign in with your existing account<ept id="p1">**</ept>, and sign into your Power BI account.
3. Enter an <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>App Name<ept id="p1">**</ept> such as "Sample push data app".
4. For <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>App Type<ept id="p1">**</ept>, choose <bpt id="p2">**</bpt>Native app<ept id="p2">**</ept>.
5. Enter a <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Redirect URL<ept id="p1">**</ept>, such as <bpt id="p2">**</bpt>https://login.live.com/oauth20_desktop.srf<ept id="p2">**</ept>. For a <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Native client app<ept id="p1">**</ept>, a redirect uri gives <bpt id="p2">**</bpt>Azure AD<ept id="p2">**</ept> more details on the specific application that it will authenticate. The standard Uri for a client app is https://login.live.com/oauth20_desktop.srf.
6. For <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Choose APIs to access<ept id="p1">**</ept>, choose <bpt id="p2">**</bpt>Read and Write All Datasets<ept id="p2">**</ept>. For all Power BI app permissions, see <bpt id="p1">[</bpt>Power BI Permissions<ept id="p1">](powerbi-developer-power-bi-permissions.md)</ept>.
7. Click <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Register app<ept id="p1">**</ept>, and save the <bpt id="p2">**</bpt>Client ID<ept id="p2">**</ept> that was generated. A <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Client ID<ept id="p1">**</ept> identifies the app in Azure AD.
