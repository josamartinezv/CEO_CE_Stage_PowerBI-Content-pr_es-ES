# Connect to an Impala database in Power BI Desktop (Preview)

In Power BI Desktop, you can connect to an <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Impala<ept id="p1">**</ept> database and use the underlying data just like any other data source in Power BI Desktop.

><bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Note:<ept id="p1">**</ept> Once you put in your username and password for a particular <bpt id="p2">**</bpt>Impala<ept id="p2">**</ept> server, Power BI Desktop uses those same credentials in subsequent connection attempts.

Once you successfully connect, a <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Navigator<ept id="p1">**</ept> window appears and displays the data available on the server, from which you can select one or multiple elements to import and use in <bpt id="p2">**</bpt>Power BI Desktop<ept id="p2">**</ept>.
