# Power BI Unified Notification Center

The Unified Notification Center is a sequential feed of information related to your Power BI experience. Open it to see messages about new dashboards that have been shared with you, changes to your Group space, information about Power BI events and meetings, alerts you've set, and more. You can <bpt id="p1">[</bpt>set alerts in the Power BI service<ept id="p1">](powerbi-service-set-data-alerts.md)</ept> and also in the Power BI mobile apps.
