# Support for Office 365 dedicated customers - known issues

Power BI is now supported for Office 365 Dedicated customers.  If you are an O365 Dedicated customer, you can sign in with an account from that tenant and use Power BI. There are two known issues currently.

## Grupos

When selecting <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Members<ept id="p1">**</ept> or <bpt id="p2">**</bpt>Calendar<ept id="p2">**</ept> in the Group context menu, you will be redirected to the Mail app instead.  <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Files<ept id="p1">**</ept> and <bpt id="p2">**</bpt>Conversations<ept id="p2">**</ept> work as expected.

## iPhone App - sign in with vanity domain leads to error

When you sign in, on the iPhone app, using a login with a vanity domain, you may encounter an error.

*Sign In error*  
*An unexpected internal error occurred. Int√©ntelo de nuevo.*

To work around this issue, sign in with the email address listed when you click on the user icon within the Power BI service instead of with the vanity domain.
