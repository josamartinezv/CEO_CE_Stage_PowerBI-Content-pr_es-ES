# Publishing and Sharing

Welcome to the <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Publishing and Sharing<ept id="p1">**</ept> section of the <bpt id="p2">**</bpt>Guided Learning<ept id="p2">**</ept> course for Power BI.

Now that you've learned how Excel and Power BI work seamlessly together, and you've learned all about the visuals you can create in reports and dashboards, you likely want to share them with your coworkers and friends. With Power BI, <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>publishing and sharing<ept id="p1">**</ept> are easy to accomplish.

This section shows you just how easy it is to bring Excel workbooks into Power BI, and demonstrates that Power BI and Excel make a great partnership.

## Share and collaborate with colleagues in Power BI

*Get introduced to the tools that make sharing and collaborating easier with Power BI*

In this module, we cover the various ways Power BI offers for sharing and collaborating with your colleagues on your dashboards, reports, and data. Por ejemplo, puede:

-   <bpt id="p1">*</bpt>Publish your reports<ept id="p1">*</ept> from Power BI Desktop to the Power BI service
-   Use <bpt id="p1">*</bpt>Power BI mobile<ept id="p1">*</ept> apps to view and interact with reports and dashboards
-   Create <bpt id="p1">*</bpt>Content packs<ept id="p1">*</ept> that package up a dashboard, report, and dataset to send to your colleagues. They can use it as a starting point and further enhance it.
-   Create <bpt id="p1">*</bpt>Groups<ept id="p1">*</ept>, which you can use as a security model to identify a subset of users who have access to dashboards, reports, and datasets you create.

Throughout much of this module we use the scenario of setting up a new finance group. We'll show how to set up the group, share dashboards, reports, and datasets into the group, and add members who'll have access to the items in the group.
