<bpt id="p1">[</bpt>Create Reporting Services mobile reports<ept id="p1">](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt652547.aspx)</ept> with SQL Server Mobile Report Publisher and publish them to the <bpt id="p2">[</bpt>Reporting Services web portal<ept id="p2">](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt637133.aspx)</ept>. Create KPIs right in the web portal. Organize them in folders and mark your favorites, so you can find them easily. 

Then in the Android app for Power BI, view the mobile reports and KPIs, organized in folders or collected as favorites. 

## Explore samples without an SSRS server

Even if you don't have access to a Reporting Services web portal, you can still explore the features of Reporting Services mobile reports. 

-  Tap the options icon <ph id="ph1">![](media/powerbi-mobile-android-kpis-mobile-reports/pbi_and_menuiconbordr.png)</ph> in the upper-left corner, scroll down and tap SQL Server RS Samples.

Browse the samples to interact with KPIs and mobile reports.

3. Tap the options icon <ph id="ph1">![](media/powerbi-mobile-android-kpis-mobile-reports/pbi_and_menuiconbordr.png)</ph> in the upper-left corner, and tap <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Connect to SSRS server<ept id="p1">**</ept>.

4. Fill in the server address and your user name and password, in this format:

    ![](media/powerbi-mobile-android-kpis-mobile-reports/pbi_ssrs_and_connect.png)

    ><bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Note<ept id="p1">**</ept>: Include <bpt id="p2">**</bpt>http<ept id="p2">**</ept> or <bpt id="p3">**</bpt>https<ept id="p3">**</ept> in front of the connection string. For example, http://<bpt id="p1">*</bpt>servername<ept id="p1">*</ept>.com/reports.

    Tap <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Advanced option<ept id="p1">**</ept> to give the server a name, if you'd like.

## Remove a connection to a report server

You can only be connected to one report server at a time from your Android app. If you want to connect to a different server, you need to disconnect from the current one.

2. Tap the ellipsis (<bpt id="p1">**</bpt>...<ept id="p1">**</ept>) next to the server name you don't want to be connected to.
3. Tap <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Remove Connection<ept id="p1">**</ept>.


## Create Reporting Services mobile reports and KPIs

- <bpt id="p1">[</bpt>Create your own Reporting Services mobile reports<ept id="p1">](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt652547.aspx)</ept> and publish them to the Reporting Services web portal.
- Create <bpt id="p1">[</bpt>KPIs on the Reporting Services web portal<ept id="p1">](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt683632.aspx)</ept>
