# Featured dashboards in Power BI

## Create a Featured dashboard

Many of you have one dashboard that you visit more than any others.  It might be the dashboard you use to run your business, or it might contain an aggregation of tiles from many different dashboards and reports.

To make it easier to reach the dashboard you care about most, we added the ability to feature a dashboard in your workspace. This means Power BI will always open to this dashboard (instead of the last dashboard you visited).  And you can reach your Featured dashboard at any time by selecting  <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Featured dashboard<ept id="p1">**</ept> in the left navigation pane.

><bpt id="p1">**</bpt>NOTE<ept id="p1">**</ept>: You can also select a few dashboards and set them as <bpt id="p2">*</bpt>favorites<ept id="p2">*</ept>. See <bpt id="p1">[</bpt>Dashboard favorites<ept id="p1">](powerbi-service-favorite-dashboards.md)</ept>.


The <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Featured dashboard<ept id="p1">**</ept> section of your left navpane will be greyed out until you set a dashboard as featured.

3. After you see the Success message, the <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Featured dashboard<ept id="p1">**</ept> option is activated in the left navpane.

## Change the Featured dashboard

Of course, if you change your mind later you can set a new dashboard as the Featured dashboard, or you can remove the Featured dashboard altogether.

1. Select the ‘…’ and choose <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Disable Featured dashboard<ept id="p1">**</ept>.

2. Confirm that you no longer want to feature this particular dashboard. Un-featuring a dashboard does not remove it from your workspace.
