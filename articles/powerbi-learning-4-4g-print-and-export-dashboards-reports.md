# Print and export Power BI dashboards

Sometimes you may want to bring a printed report or dashboard to a meeting, or so you can share it with others. With Power BI, there are a few days you can make printouts of your visuals.

In the Power BI service, select the ellipses (three dots) in the top-right side of the service, and select <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Print dashboard<ept id="p1">**</ept>.

A <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Print<ept id="p1">**</ept> dialog appears, where you can select the printer to which you want to send the dashboard, as well as standard print options such as <bpt id="p2">*</bpt>portrait<ept id="p2">*</ept> or <bpt id="p3">*</bpt>landscape<ept id="p3">*</ept> orientation.

## Export data from a visual

You can also export the data from any visual in the Power BI service. Just select the ellipses on any visual, and then select the <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Export data<ept id="p1">**</ept> button (the middle button). When you do so, a .CSV file is created and downloaded to your local computer, and a message appears on your browser (just like any other browser-initiated download) letting you know the download is complete.

You can also print or export directly from a report. When viewing a report in the Power BI service, select <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>File &gt; Print<ept id="p1">**</ept> to open the print dialog.

And just like with a dashboard, you can export data from a visual within a report, too, by selecting the export button on a visual.
