# Display a dashboard tile in full screen mode

Tiles must first be <bpt id="p1">[</bpt>popped out<ept id="p1">](powerbi-service-display-dash-in-focus-mode.md)</ept> before they can be displayed in full screen mode.

## What is Full Screen Mode?

Display your <bpt id="p1">[</bpt>dashboards, reports<ept id="p1">](powerbi-service-dash-and-reports-fullscreen.md)</ept>, and tiles without the distraction of menus and navigation buttons.  You get an unadulterated, full view of your business at a glance, all the time. This is sometimes referred to as TV Mode.

Some uses for full screen mode are:

- presenting your tile at a meeting or conference
- displaying your tile in an office on a dedicated large screen or projector
- looking at your tile on a small screen
- reviewing your tile in locked mode -- you can touch the screen or mouse over the tile without opening the underlying report


## To turn full screen mode on (and off)

1. <bpt id="p1">[</bpt>Pop out the tile and display it in Focus mode<ept id="p1">](powerbi-service-display-dash-in-focus-mode.md)</ept>.

    Your tile fills the report canvas.

4.  In full screen mode, the tile fills your entire screen.
