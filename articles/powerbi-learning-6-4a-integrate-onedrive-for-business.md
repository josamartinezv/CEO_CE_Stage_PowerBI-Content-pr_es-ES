# Integrate OneDrive for Business with Power BI

In an earlier article we reviewed creating groups to help your organization manage and collaborate on content that's in Power BI. You can also use your Power BI / Office365 groups to collaborate and share by using <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>OneDrive for Business<ept id="p1">**</ept>.

Using OneDrive for Business as a source for your Power BI content gives you access to a number of helpful tools, such as version history. You can also share your files with an Office365 group from within OneDrive for Business to give access and allow many people to work on the same Power BI or Excel files.

To connect to a PBIX (Power BI Desktop) file on OneDrive for Business, log into the Power BI service and select <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Get Data<ept id="p1">**</ept>. Choose <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Files<ept id="p1">**</ept> under Import or Connect to Data, and then select <bpt id="p2">**</bpt>OneDrive - Business<ept id="p2">**</ept>.

Now, any changes made to the file on <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>OneDrive for Business<ept id="p1">**</ept> will be automatically reflected in the Power BI environment as well, and recorded in the version history.
