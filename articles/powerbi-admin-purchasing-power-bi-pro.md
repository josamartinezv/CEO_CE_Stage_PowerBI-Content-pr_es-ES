# Purchasing Power BI Pro

Power BI Pro provides access to features that a free user does not have. This includes use of the On-Premises Data Gateway for on-premises data refresh to data sources such as SQL Server, Groups and other features. For more information, see <bpt id="p1">[</bpt>Power BI Pro content - what is it?<ept id="p1">](powerbi-power-bi-pro-content-what-is-it.md)</ept>.

You can purchase Power BI Pro directly through the Power BI website, the Office 365 admin center or through your Microsoft representative or partner. This article will look at the two trial options available for Power BI Pro, and then how to purchase Power BI Pro as an individual, or as an organization.
