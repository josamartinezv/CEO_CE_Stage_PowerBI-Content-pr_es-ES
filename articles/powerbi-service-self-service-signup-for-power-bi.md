# Self-service sign up for Power BI

Signing up for Power BI, as an individual, is easy! You can choose to use a free account, a Pro trial account, or purchase Power BI Pro, even if you are in an existing organization. Once you have determined which you would like to use, this article will walk you through the steps to get up and running.

> [AZURE.NOTE] If you are in an organization, individual sign up may be disabled. See <bpt id="p1">[</bpt>Individual Sign up has been turned off<ept id="p1">](#individual-sign-up-has-been-turned-off)</ept> for more information if you get an error indicating it has been turned off.

## What email address can be used with Power BI?

Power BI requires that you use a work, or school, email address to sign up. Power BI does not support email addresses provided by consumer email services or telecommunication providers. This includes outlook.com, hotmail.com, gmail.com and others.

If you try to sign up with a personal email address, you will get a message indicating to use a work or school email address.

## Individual Sign up has been turned off

When trying to sign up for Power BI, you may encounter the following message.

    Your IT department has turned off signup for Microsoft Power BI.
 
![](media/powerbi-service-self-service-signup-for-power-bi/allowadhocsubscriptionfalse.png)

This could be because your organization has disabled individual sign ups. It could also be because you purchased Office 365 through a partner. 
            [Obtenga más información](powerbi-admin-syndication-partner.md).

If your organization has disabled individual sign ups, you will need to work with your IT group to get a Power BI license assigned to your account in order to continue.
