# Connect to a Web page from Power BI Desktop

You can connect to a Web page, and import its data into Power BI Desktop, to use in your visuals and in your data models.

In Power BI Desktop, select <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Get Data &gt; Web<ept id="p1">**</ept> from the <bpt id="p2">**</bpt>Home<ept id="p2">**</ept> ribbon.

A dialog appears, asking for the URL of the Web page from which you want to import data.

Once you’ve typed in (or pasted) the URL, select <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>OK<ept id="p1">**</ept>. Power BI Desktop connects to that page, then presents the page’s available data in the <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Navigator<ept id="p1">**</ept> window. When you select one of the available data elements, such as a table of the entire page, the <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Navigator<ept id="p1">**</ept> window displays a preview of that data on the right side of the window.

You can choose the <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Edit<ept id="p1">**</ept> button, which launches <bpt id="p2">**</bpt>Query Editor<ept id="p2">**</ept>, where you can shape and transform the data on that Web page before importing it into Power BI Desktop. Or you can select the <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Load<ept id="p1">**</ept> button, and import all of the data elements you selected in the left pane.

When we select <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Load<ept id="p1">**</ept>, Power BI Desktop imports the selected items, and makes them available in the <bpt id="p2">**</bpt>Fields<ept id="p2">**</ept> pane, found on the right side of the Reports view in Power BI Desktop.

That’s all there is to connecting to a Web page, and bring its data into Power BI Desktop.

From there, you can drag those fields onto the Report canvas and create all the visualizations you want. You can also work this the data from that Web page just like you would any other data – you can shape it, you can create relationships between it and other data sources in your model, and otherwise do what you’d like to create just the Power BI report you want.

To see connecting to a Web page in more depth and action, take a look at the <bpt id="p1">[</bpt>Power BI Desktop Getting Started Guide<ept id="p1">](powerbi-desktop-getting-started.md)</ept>.
