# How to Use Waterfall and Funnel Charts

Waterfall and funnel charts are two of the more interesting (and perhaps uncommon) standard visualizations that are included in Power BI. To create a blank chart of either type, select its icon from the <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Visualizations<ept id="p1">**</ept> pane.

<bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Waterfall charts<ept id="p1">**</ept> are typically used to show changes in a particular value over time.

Waterfalls only have two bucket options: <bpt id="p1">*</bpt>Category<ept id="p1">*</ept> and <bpt id="p2">*</bpt>Y Axis<ept id="p2">*</ept>. Drag a time-based field such as <bpt id="p1">*</bpt>year<ept id="p1">*</ept> to the <bpt id="p2">*</bpt>Category<ept id="p2">*</ept> bucket, and the value you want to track to the <bpt id="p3">*</bpt>Y Axis<ept id="p3">*</ept> bucket. Time periods where there was an increase in value are displayed in green by default, while periods with a decrease in value are displayed in red.

<bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Funnel charts<ept id="p1">**</ept> are typically used to show changes over a particular process, such as a sales pipeline or website retention efforts.

Both <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Waterfall<ept id="p1">**</ept> and <bpt id="p2">**</bpt>Funnel<ept id="p2">**</ept> charts can be sliced and visually customized.
