# Printing from Power BI

Print an entire dashboard, a dashboard tile, a report page, or a report visual from Power BI service. Reports can only be printed one page at a time -- you can't print the entire report at once.

>[AZURE.NOTE] Printing is only available in Power BI service and not Power BI Desktop.

Watch Amanda print from her dashboard and report. Then follow the step-by-step instructions below the video to try it out yourself.

##  Solucionar problemas

*   Q: I cannot find the <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Print<ept id="p1">**</ept> button.
*   A: If you are using Power BI Desktop, printing is not supported.  Printing only works in Power BI service.


*   Q: I cannot print all the report pages at once.
*   A: That is correct. Report pages can only be printed one page at a time.


*   Q: I cannot print to PDF.
*   A: You will only see this option if you've already configured the PDF driver in your browser.    


*   Q: What I see when I select <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Print<ept id="p1">**</ept> doesn't match what you're showing me here.
*   A: The Print screens vary by browser and software version.


*   Q: My printout isn't scaled correctly.  My dashboard doesn't fit on the page. Other scaling and orientation questions.
*   A: Things like scaling, margins, orientation, size are not controlled by Power BI. For help with issues like this, refer to the documentation for your specific browser.
