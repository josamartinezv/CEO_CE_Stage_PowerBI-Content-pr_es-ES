# Azure SQL Data Warehouse with DirectQuery

Azure SQL Data Warehouse with DirectQuery allows you to create dynamic reports based on data and metrics you already have in Azure SQL Data Warehouse. With DirectQuery, queries are sent back to your Azure SQL Data Warehouse in real time as you explore the data. This, combined with the scale of SQL Data Warehouse enables users to create dynamic reports in minutes against terabytes of data. In addition, the introduction of the <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Open in Power BI<ept id="p1">**</ept> button allows users to directly connect Power BI to their SQL Data Warehouse without having to manually specify the information.

NOTES: When using the SQL Data Warehouse connector:

-   Specify the fully qualified server name when connecting (see below for details)

-   Ensure firewall rules for the server are configured to "Allow access to Azure services"

-   Every action such as selecting a column or adding a filter will directly query the data warehouse

-   Tiles are set to refresh approximately every 15 minutes and refresh does not need to be scheduled.  This can be adjusted in the Advanced settings when you connect.

-   Q&amp;A is not available for DirectQuery datasets

-   schema changes are not picked up automatically

These restrictions and notes may change as we continue to improve the experiences. The step to connect are detailed below.

## Using the 'Open in Power BI' button

The easiest way to move between your SQL Data Warehouse and Power BI is with the <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Open in Power BI<ept id="p1">**</ept> button within the Azure Preview Portal. This button allows you to seamlessly begin creating new dashboards in Power BI.

1. To get started, navigate to your SQL Data Warehouse instance in the Azure Preview Portal. Please note that SQL Data Warehouse only have a presence in the Azure Preview portal at this time.

2. Click the <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Open in Power BI<ept id="p1">**</ept> button

    > <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Note<ept id="p1">**</ept>: The username will be a user that is defined in your Azure SQL Data Warehouse instance.

5. Drill into the dataset by selecting the new tile or the newly created dataset, indicated by the asterisk. This dataset will have the same name as your database.

6. You can explore all of the tables and columns. Selecting a column will send a query back to the source, dynamically creating your visual. Filters will also be translated into queries back to your data warehouse. These visuals can be saved in a new report and pinned back to your dashboard.
