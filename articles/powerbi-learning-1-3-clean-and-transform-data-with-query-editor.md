Once Query Editor is loaded with data that's ready for you to shape, you see a handful of sections:

1.  In the ribbon, many buttons are now active to interact with the data in the query
2.  In the left pane, queries (one for each table, or entity) are listed and available for selection, viewing, and shaping
3.  In the center pane, data from the selected query is displayed and available for shaping
4.  The Query Settings window appears, listing the queryâ€™s properties and applied steps

In the center pane, right-clicking on a column displays a number of different available transformations, such as removing the column from the table, duplicating the column under a new name, and replacing values. From this menu you can also split text columns into multiples by common delimiters.
