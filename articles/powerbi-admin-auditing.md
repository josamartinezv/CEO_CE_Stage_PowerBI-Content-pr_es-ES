# Auditing Power BI in your organization

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zj4kA39jV_4?showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Learn how you can use auditing with Power BI to monitor and investigate actions taken. You can use the Security and compliance center or use PowerShell.

Knowing who is taking what action on which item in your Power BI tenant can be critical in helping your organization fulfill its requirements, such as meeting regulatory compliance and records management.

You can filter the audit data by date range, user, dashboard, report, dataset and activity type. You can also download the activities in a csv (comma separated value) file to analyze offline.

> [AZURE.NOTE] The auditing feature in Power BI is in preview and is available in all data regions except those in Austrailia and Europe.

## Enabling auditing functionality in the Power BI admin portal

You will need to enable auditing for your organization in order to work with the reports. You can do this within the tenant settings of the admin portal.

1.  Select the <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>gear icon<ept id="p1">**</ept> in the upper right.

2.  Select <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Admin Portal<ept id="p1">**</ept>.

    ![](media/powerbi-admin-auditing/powerbi-admin.png)

3.  Select <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Tenant Settings<ept id="p1">**</ept>.

    ![](media/powerbi-admin-auditing/powerbi-admin-tenant-settings.png)

4.  Switch on <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Create audit logs for internal activity auditing and compliance purposes<ept id="p1">**</ept>.

5.  Select <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Apply<ept id="p1">**</ept>.

Power BI will start logging various activities that your users perform in Power BI. The logs take up to 48 hours to show up in the O365 Security &amp; Compliance Center. For more information about what activities are logged, see <bpt id="p1">[</bpt>List of activities audited by Power BI<ept id="p1">](#list-of-activities-audited-by-power-bi)</ept>.

## Licensing requirements

Auditing is a Power BI Pro feature and auditing events are only available for Power BI Pro users.  Users with Power BI (free) licenses will be displayed as <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Free User<ept id="p1">**</ept>.

For more information on how you can acquire and assign Power BI Pro licenses to users in your organization, see <bpt id="p1">[</bpt>Purchasing Power BI Pro<ept id="p1">](powerbi-admin-purchasing-powerb-bi-pro.md)</ept>.

For more information on how to restrict free users from signing up, see <bpt id="p1">[</bpt>Enable, or disable, individual user sign up in Azure Active Directory<ept id="p1">](powerbi-admin-powerbi-free-in-your-organization.md#enable-or-disable-individual-user-sign-up-in-azure-active-directory)</ept>.

> [AZURE.NOTE] To enable auditing for Power BI in your tenant, you need at least one exchange mailbox license in your tenant.

## Accessing your audit logs

To audit your Power BI logs, you must visit the O365 Security &amp; Compliance Center.

1.  Select the <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>gear icon<ept id="p1">**</ept> in the upper right.

2.  Select <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Admin Portal<ept id="p1">**</ept>.

    ![](media/powerbi-admin-auditing/powerbi-admin.png)

3.  Select <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Audit Logs<ept id="p1">**</ept>.

4.  Select <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Go to O365 Admin Center<ept id="p1">**</ept>.

    ![](media/powerbi-admin-auditing/audit-log-o365-admin-center.png)

Alternatively, you can browse to <bpt id="p1">[</bpt>Office 365 | Security &amp; Compliance<ept id="p1">](https://protection.office.com/#/unifiedauditlog)</ept>.

> [AZURE.NOTE] To provide non-administrator accounts with access to the audit log, you will need to assign permissions within the Exchange Online Admin Center. For example, you could assign a user to an existing role group, such as Organization Management, or you could create a new role group with the Audit Logs role. For more information, see <bpt id="p1">[</bpt>Permissions in Exchange Online<ept id="p1">](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/jj200692\(v=exchg.150\).aspx)</ept>.

## Search only Power BI activities

You can restrict results to only Power BI activities by doing the following.

1.  On the <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Audit log search<ept id="p1">**</ept> page, select the drop down for <bpt id="p2">**</bpt>Activities<ept id="p2">**</ept> under <bpt id="p3">**</bpt>Search<ept id="p3">**</ept>.

2.  Select <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>PowerBI activities<ept id="p1">**</ept>.

    ![](media/powerbi-admin-auditing/audit-log-search-filter-by-powerbi.png)

3.  Select anywhere outside of the selection box to close it.

Your searches will now be filtered to only Power BI activities.

## Search the audit logs by date

You can search the logs by date range using the “Start date” and “End date” field. The last seven days are selected by default. The date and time are presented in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) format. The maximum date range that you can specify is 90 days. An error is displayed if the selected date range is greater than 90 days.

> [AZURE.NOTE] If you're using the maximum date range of 90 days, select the current time for the Start date. Otherwise, you'll receive an error saying that the start date is earlier than the end date. If you've turned on auditing within the last 90 days, the maximum date range can't start before the date that auditing was turned on.

![](media/powerbi-admin-auditing/search-audit-log-by-date.png)

## Search the audit logs by users

You can search for audit log entries for activities performed by specific users. To do this, enter one or more user names in the “Users” field.  This would be the username that they sign into Power BI with. It looks like an email address.
Leave this box blank to return entries for all users (and service accounts) in your organization.

![](media/powerbi-admin-auditing/search-audit-log-by-user.png)

## Viewing search results

Once you hit the search button, the search results are loaded and after a few moments they are displayed under Results. When the search is finished, the number of results found is displayed. 

> [AZURE.NOTE] A maximum of 1000 events will be displayed; if more than 1000 events meet the search criteria, the newest 1000 events are displayed.

The results contain the following information about each event returned by the search.

|**Columna**|**Definición**|
|---|---|
|Fecha|The date and time (in UTC format) when the event occurred.|
|Dirección IP|The IP address of the device that was used when the activity was logged. The IP address is displayed in either an IPv4 or IPv6 address format.|
|User|The user (or service account) who performed the action that triggered the event.|

> [AZURE.NOTE] Select a column header under Results to sort the results. You can sort the results from A to Z or Z to A. Click the Date header to sort the results from oldest to newest or newest to oldest.

## View the details for an event

You can view more details about an event by selecting the event record in the list of search results. A details page is displayed that contains the detailed properties from the event record.
