# Congratulations - and what's next for you

You did it! **Enhorabuena.** You've completed the <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Guided Learning<ept id="p1">**</ept> course for Power BI. You've come full circle from learning the basic elements of Power BI, taken a tour through its software features and elements, and learned how they all work together.

![](media/powerbi-learning-0-0-what-is-power-bi/c0a0_2.png)

This is the last section (and the final topic, unless you want to learn DAX) in the course, so if you went through all of these sections in order, take a moment to pat yourself on the back. Good job! You're now well versed in all these <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>important concepts<ept id="p1">**</ept>:

-   What <bpt id="p1">[</bpt>Power BI is<ept id="p1">](powerbi-learning-0-0-what-is-power-bi.md)</ept>
-   The <bpt id="p1">[</bpt>building blocks<ept id="p1">](powerbi-learning-0b-building-blocks-power-bi.md)</ept> of Power BI
-   <bpt id="p1">[</bpt>Getting<ept id="p1">](powerbi-learning-1-2-connect-to-data-sources-in-power-bi-desktop.md)</ept> and <bpt id="p2">[</bpt>modeling<ept id="p2">](powerbi-learning-2-1-intro-modeling-data.md)</ept> data

-   Using <bpt id="p1">[</bpt>Excel and Power BI<ept id="p1">](powerbi-learning-5-1-intro-excel-data.md)</ept> together
-   And <bpt id="p1">[</bpt>publishing and sharing<ept id="p1">](powerbi-learning-6-0-intro-content-packs-groups.md)</ept> your work

That's a lot of knowledge, and now that you have all this in your head, you're ready to go put it to use! Here are some <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>links to downloads<ept id="p1">**</ept> or to get your browser <bpt id="p2">**</bpt>connected to the Power BI service<ept id="p2">**</ept>:

-   You can always <bpt id="p1">[</bpt>get the latest Power BI Desktop<ept id="p1">](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/desktop)</ept>
-   Heading to the <bpt id="p1">[</bpt>Power BI service<ept id="p1">](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/)</ept> is easy

## One more section for DAX users

Still want more? Interested in using <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)<ept id="p1">**</ept> to create, filter, or use custom columns and tables in Power BI? There's one more section targeted at people inclined to do some code work in Power BI, and it's called <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Introduction to DAX<ept id="p1">**</ept>. Take a look if you're interested - it uses the same friendly approach as the rest of Guided Learning.
