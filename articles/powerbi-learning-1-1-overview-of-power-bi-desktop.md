# Getting Data

Welcome to the second section in this <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Guided Learning<ept id="p1">**</ept> course for Power BI, called <bpt id="p2">**</bpt>Getting Data<ept id="p2">**</ept>. This section looks at the many data-centric features and tools of Power BI, focusing on Power BI Desktop. Many of these tools also apply to the Power BI service, so you're doing double duty with your learning in this section.

When you get data, sometimes it's not quite as well-formed, or <bpt id="p1">*</bpt>clean<ept id="p1">*</ept>, as you want it to be. So in this section you learn how to get data, how to clean it up (sometimes called <bpt id="p1">*</bpt>cleaning<ept id="p1">*</ept> or <bpt id="p2">*</bpt>transforming<ept id="p2">*</ept> data), and also learn some advanced tricks that can make your data-getting life easier.

As always in this course, your learning journey follows the same path as the flow of work in Power BI. As such, let's check out <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Power BI Desktop<ept id="p1">**</ept>, where it often begins.
