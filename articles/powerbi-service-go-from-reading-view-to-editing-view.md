# Go from Reading View to Editing View in Power BI

In Editing View in Power BI (compared to <bpt id="p1">[</bpt>Reading View<ept id="p1">](powerbi-service-interact-with-a-report-in-reading-view.md)</ept>) you can dig even deeper into your data by adding and removing fields, changing visualization type, creating new visualizations, and adding and deleting visualizations and pages from the report.  To edit a report, you must be the owner of the report.

1.  In Reading View, select <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Edit Report<ept id="p1">**</ept>.

    The report is now in Editing View and uses the same <bpt id="p1">[</bpt>display settings<ept id="p1">](powerbi-service-change-report-display-settings.md)</ept> you last used in Reading View.

2. To return to <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Reading View<ept id="p1">**</ept>, select Reading View from the top navigation bar.
