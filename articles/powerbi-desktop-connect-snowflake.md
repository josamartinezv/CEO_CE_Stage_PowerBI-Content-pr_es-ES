# Connect to a Snowflake computing warehouse in Power BI Desktop (Preview)

In Power BI Desktop, you can connect to a <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Snowflake<ept id="p1">**</ept> computing warehouse and use the underlying data just like any other data source in Power BI Desktop. This release of the <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Snowflake<ept id="p1">**</ept> connector is in Preview, and is subject to change.

## Enable the Snowflake (Preview) feature

To get access to the <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Snowflake<ept id="p1">**</ept> connector, you first need to enable this preview feature. In <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Power BI Desktop<ept id="p1">**</ept>, select <bpt id="p2">**</bpt>File &gt; Options and settings &gt; Option<ept id="p2">**</ept> then in the <bpt id="p3">**</bpt>Options<ept id="p3">**</ept> window, select the <bpt id="p4">**</bpt>Preview Features<ept id="p4">**</ept> section and enable <bpt id="p5">**</bpt>Snowflake<ept id="p5">**</ept>, as shown below.

When you check that box, you turn on the <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Snowflake<ept id="p1">**</ept> preview feature. You'll need to restart Power BI Desktop for the change to take effect. Once you do, the preview feature is available.

You also <bpt id="p1">*</bpt>must<ept id="p1">*</ept> install the <bpt id="p2">**</bpt>Snowflake ODBC driver<ept id="p2">**</ept> on computers that use the <bpt id="p3">**</bpt>Snowflake<ept id="p3">**</ept> connector, using the architecture that matches the installation of <bpt id="p4">**</bpt>Power BI Desktop<ept id="p4">**</ept>, either 32-bit or 64-bit. Just follow the following link and <bpt id="p1">[</bpt>download the appropriate Snowflake ODBC driver<ept id="p1">](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=823762)</ept>.

><bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Note:<ept id="p1">**</ept> Once you put in your username and password for a particular <bpt id="p2">**</bpt>Snowflake<ept id="p2">**</ept> server, Power BI Desktop uses those same credentials in subsequent connection attempts. You can modify those credentials by going to <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>File &gt; Options and settings &gt; Data source settings<ept id="p1">**</ept>.

Once you successfully connect, a <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Navigator<ept id="p1">**</ept> window appears and displays the data available on the server, from which you can select one or multiple elements to import and use in <bpt id="p2">**</bpt>Power BI Desktop<ept id="p2">**</ept>.

You can <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Load<ept id="p1">**</ept> the selected table, which brings the entire table into <bpt id="p2">**</bpt>Power BI Desktop<ept id="p2">**</ept>, or you can <bpt id="p3">**</bpt>Edit<ept id="p3">**</ept> the query, which opens <bpt id="p4">**</bpt>Query Editor<ept id="p4">**</ept> so you can filter and refine the set of data you want to use, and then load that refined set of data into <bpt id="p5">**</bpt>Power BI Desktop<ept id="p5">**</ept>.
