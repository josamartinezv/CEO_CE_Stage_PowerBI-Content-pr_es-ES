# Dashboards in Power BI

Dashboards, reports, and datasets are at the heart of Power BI service. Create personalized <bpt id="p1">***</bpt>dashboards<ept id="p1">***</ept> to monitor your most important data, at a glance.  A dashboard combines on-premises and cloud-born data in a single pane of glass, providing a consolidated view across the organization regardless of where the data lives. Each metric, or insight, is displayed on the dashboard as a <bpt id="p1">***</bpt>tile<ept id="p1">***</ept>. 

Need help understanding the building blocks that make up Power BI?  See <bpt id="p1">[</bpt>Power BI - Basic Concepts<ept id="p1">](powerbi-service-basic-concepts.md)</ept>.

There are samples available for you to use with Power BI. Below shows the Retail Analysis Sample. For detailed information about the sample, see <bpt id="p1">[</bpt>Sample datasets<ept id="p1">](powerbi-sample-datasets.md)</ept>.

Each tile is a snapshot of information taken from an underlying dataset.  Learn how to <bpt id="p1">[</bpt>add tiles to a dashboard<ept id="p1">](powerbi-service-dashboard-tiles.md)</ept>. The tiles on a dashboard can be <bpt id="p1">[</bpt>resized, moved, deleted, linked, and renamed<ept id="p1">](powerbi-service-edit-a-tile-in-a-dashboard.md)</ept>.

### Dashboard size

Display your dashboard without controls and menus using <bpt id="p1">[</bpt>full screen mode<ept id="p1">](powerbi-service-dash-and-reports-fullscreen.md)</ept>.

Dashboards can be wider and longer than the browser window. If so, they have scroll bars. Because you want to show everything important at a glance, we recommend making the dashboard fit the browser window.

### Working with Dashboards in the navigation pane

Power BI can have more than one dashboard -- as you add more dashboards, their titles are added to the list under the <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Dashboards<ept id="p1">**</ept> heading.  The dashboard you're currently viewing is highlighted. Only one dashboard can be open at a time.
