# <a name="about-filters-and-highlighting-in-power-bi-reports"></a>About filters and highlighting in Power BI reports

<bpt id="p1">***</bpt>Filters<ept id="p1">***</ept> remove all but the data you want to focus on.  <bpt id="p1">***</bpt>Highlighting<ept id="p1">***</ept> is not filtering since it does not remove data but instead highlights a subset of the visible data; the unhighlighted data remains visible but dimmed.

There are a lot of different ways you can filter and highlight reports in Power BI. Putting all of that information in one article would get confusing, so we've broken it down like this:

-   Introduction to filters and highlighting (the article you're reading now)

-   The ways you can <bpt id="p1">[</bpt>create and use filters and highlighting in Editing View/reports that you own<ept id="p1">](powerbi-service-add-a-filter-to-a-report.md)</ept>. When you have editing permissions for a report, you can create, modify, and delete filters and highlighting in reports.

-   The ways you can <bpt id="p1">[</bpt>use filters and highlighting in a report shared with you or in report Reading View<ept id="p1">](powerbi-service-interact-with-a-report-in-reading-view.md)</ept>. What you can do is more limited, but Power BI still gives you a wide range of filtering and highlighting options.  

-   <bpt id="p1">[</bpt>A detailed tour of the filter and highlighting controls available in Editing View<ept id="p1">](powerbi-service-how-to-use-a-report-filter.md)</ept> including an in-depth look at types of filters (e.g., date and time, numeric, text) and the difference between basic and advanced options.

-   Now that you've learned how filers and highlighting work by default, <bpt id="p1">[</bpt>learn how to change the way visualizations on a page filter and highlight each other<ept id="p1">](powerbi-service-visual-interactions.md)</ept>


>[AZURE.TIP] How does Power BI knows how data is related?  It uses the relationships between the different tables and fields in the underlying <bpt id="p1">[</bpt>data model<ept id="p1">](https://support.office.com/article/Create-a-Data-Model-in-Excel-87e7a54c-87dc-488e-9410-5c75dbcb0f7b?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US)</ept> to make items on a report page interact with each other.


##  <a name="introduction-to-filters-and-highlighting-in-reports-using-the-filters-pane"></a>Introduction to filters and highlighting in reports using the Filters pane


![](media/powerbi-service-about-filters-and-highlighting-in-reports/power-bi-add-filter-reading-view.png)

Filters and highlighting can be applied using the <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Filters<ept id="p1">**</ept> pane or by making selections directly on the report itself (ad-hoc, see bottom of page). The Filters pane shows the tables and fields used in the report and the filters that have been applied, if any. The filters are divided up into <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Page level filters<ept id="p1">**</ept>, <bpt id="p2">**</bpt>Report level filters<ept id="p2">**</ept>, and <bpt id="p3">**</bpt>Visual level filters<ept id="p3">**</ept>.  You'll only see visual level filters if you've selected a visualization on the report canvas.

>[AZURE.TIP]   If the filter has the word <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>All<ept id="p1">**</ept> next to it, that means that entire field is being included as a filter.  For example, <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Chain(All)<ept id="p1">**</ept> in the screenshot below tells us that this report page includes data about all the store chains.  On the other hand, the report level filter of <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>FiscalYear is 2013 or 2014<ept id="p1">**</ept> tells us that the report only includes data for the fiscal years of 2013 and 2014.


##  <a name="filters-in-reading-view-verus-editing-view"></a>Filters in Reading View verus Editing View

There are two modes for interacting with reports: <bpt id="p1">[</bpt>Reading View<ept id="p1">](powerbi-service-interact-with-a-report-in-reading-view.md)</ept> and <bpt id="p2">[</bpt>Editing View<ept id="p2">](powerbi-service-interact-with-a-report-in-editing-view.md)</ept>.  And the filtering capabilities available to you depend on which mode you're in.

-   In Editing View, you can add report, page, and visual filters. When you save the report, the filters are saved with it. People looking at the report in Reading View can interact with the filters you added, but not save their changes.

-   In Reading View, you can interact with any page and visual filters that already exist in the report, but you won't be able to save your filter changes.


### <a name="the-filters-pane-in-reading-view"></a>The Filters pane in Reading View

If you only have access to a report in Reading View, the Filters pane looks like this:



![](media/powerbi-service-about-filters-and-highlighting-in-reports/power-bi-filter-reading-view.png)

So this page of the report has 6 page level filters and 1 report level filter.

To see if any visual level filters exist, select a visual. In the image below, the bubble chart has 6 filters applied.

![](media/powerbi-service-about-filters-and-highlighting-in-reports/power-bi-filter-visual-level.png)

In Reading View, explore the data by modifying the existing filters. Learn how in the article <bpt id="p1">[</bpt>Interact with filters in Reading view<ept id="p1">](powerbi-service-interact-with-a-report-in-reading-view.md)</ept>

### <a name="the-filters-pane-in-editing-view"></a>The Filters pane in Editing View

When you have owner permissions for a report and open it in Editing View, you see that <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Filters<ept id="p1">**</ept> is just one of several editing panes available.

![](media/powerbi-service-about-filters-and-highlighting-in-reports/power-bi-add-filter-editing-view.png)

As in Reading View (above) we see that this page of the report has 6 page level filters and 1 report level filter. And by selecting the bubble chart, we'd see it has 6 visual level filters applied.

But in Editing View, there is so much more that we can do with filters and highlighting. The main difference being that we can add new filters. Learn how to do this and so much more in the article <bpt id="p1">[</bpt>Add a filter to a report<ept id="p1">](powerbi-service-add-a-filter-to-a-report.md)</ept>

##  <a name="ad-hoc-filterting-and-highlighting"></a>Ad-hoc filterting and highlighting
Select a field on the report canvas to filter and highlight the rest of the page. Select any empty space in the same visual to remove it. This type of filtering and highlighting is not saved with the report but is fun way to quickly explore data impacts. To fine-tune how this type of cross-filtering and cross-highlighting works, see <bpt id="p1">[</bpt>Visual interactions<ept id="p1">](powerbi-service-visual-interactions.md)</ept>
