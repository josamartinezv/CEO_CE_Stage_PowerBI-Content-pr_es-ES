# Reports in Power BI

Dashboards, reports, and datasets are at the heart of Power BI. A <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>report<ept id="p1">**</ept> is a multi-perspective view into your data, with visualizations that represent different findings and insights from that data.  A report may have a single visualization or pages full of visualizations.

Need help understanding the building blocks that make up Power BI?  See <bpt id="p1">[</bpt>Power BI - Basic Concepts<ept id="p1">](powerbi-service-basic-concepts.md)</ept>.

You can <bpt id="p1">[</bpt>create a report from scratch<ept id="p1">](powerbi-service-create-a-new-report.md)</ept> or <bpt id="p2">[</bpt>have one shared with you<ept id="p2">](powerbi-service-share-unshare-dashboard.md)</ept>. And for some kinds of data, Power BI will <bpt id="p1">[</bpt>create a report for you as it adds the dataset<ept id="p1">](powerbi-service-get-data.md)</ept>.  


## View reports in the navigation pane

Power BI can have more than one report-- as you add reports, their titles are added to the list under the <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Reports<ept id="p1">**</ept> heading (see screenshot below). The report you're currently viewing is highlighted. New reports have a yellow asterisk. Only one report can be open at a time.

### Tips and troubleshooting

- Don't forget that <bpt id="p1">[</bpt>creating a report<ept id="p1">](powerbi-service-create-a-new-report.md)</ept>  requires a <bpt id="p2">[</bpt>dataset<ept id="p2">](powerbi-service-get-data.md)</ept>.  

- Make sure you understand the difference between <bpt id="p1">[</bpt>Reading View<ept id="p1">](powerbi-service-interact-with-a-report-in-reading-view.md)</ept> and <bpt id="p2">[</bpt>Editing View<ept id="p2">](powerbi-service-interact-with-a-report-in-editing-view.md)</ept>. 

- Familiarize yourself with the report editor by <bpt id="p1">[</bpt>Taking a tour<ept id="p1">](powerbi-service-the-report-editor-take-a-tour.md)</ept>.

- Modify how your reports display using <bpt id="p1">[</bpt>page display settings<ept id="p1">](powerbi-service-change-report-display-settings.md)</ept>.

- Do you know the difference between filter, highlight, cross-filter, and cross-highlight? If not, see <bpt id="p1">[</bpt>Filter and highlight data in reports<ept id="p1">](powerbi-service-about-filters-and-highlighting-in-reports.md)</ept>.

- <bpt id="p1">[</bpt>Focus mode<ept id="p1">](powerbi-service-move-and-resize-a-visualization.md)</ept> and <bpt id="p2">[</bpt>full screen TV mode<ept id="p2">](powerbi-service-dash-and-reports-fullscreen.md)</ept> -- there is a difference.
