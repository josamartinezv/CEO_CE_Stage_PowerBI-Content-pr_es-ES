# Share a dashboard from the iPhone app (Power BI for iOS)

Invite colleagues to view your dashboards by sharing links from the iPhone app for Power BI. You can only share dashboards with colleagues in the same email domain as you.

## Share a dashboard

1.  In the actions bar at the bottom of the dashboard, tap the share icon <ph id="ph1">![](media/powerbi-mobile-share-a-dashboard-from-the-iphone-app/power-bi-iphone-share-dashboard-icon.png)</ph>.

3.  Tap <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Invite a colleague<ept id="p1">**</ept>.

2.  Type names, separated by commas, and a message to accompany your dashboard invitation.

3.  To allow resharing, leave <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Allow recipients to share this dashboard<ept id="p1">**</ept> selected.

    ><bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Note<ept id="p1">**</ept>   Resharing allows your coworkers to forward the email invitation to others in your organization, either through the web or the mobile apps.

4.  Tap <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Send<ept id="p1">**</ept> in the upper-right corner.

    Your colleagues get an email invitation with a direct link to the dashboard. The invitation expires after one month. When they open it, in a browser or in the iPhone or iPad app, it's added to their Power BI.
