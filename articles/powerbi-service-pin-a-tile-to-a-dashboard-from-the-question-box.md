Q&amp;A is the Power BI ad hoc reporting tool. Need to find a particular insight? Ask a question about your data, and receive an answer in the form of a visualization.

1.  Create a <bpt id="p1">[</bpt>dashboard<ept id="p1">](powerbi-service-dashboards.md)</ept> and <bpt id="p2">[</bpt>get data<ept id="p2">](powerbi-service-get-data.md)</ept>.

2.  In the question box at the top of your dashboard, start typing what you want to know about your data.

    A success message (near the top-right corner) lets you know the visualization was added, as a tile, to your dashboard.

-   <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>How does Q&amp;A know which datasets to use<ept id="p1">**</ept>?  Q&amp;A has access to all datasets that have visualizations pinned to that dashboard.
