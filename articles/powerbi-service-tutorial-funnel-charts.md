# Tutorial: funnel charts in Power BI

A funnel chart helps you visualize a linear process that has sequential connected stages. For example, a sales funnel that tracks customers through stages: Lead <ph id="ph1">\&gt;</ph> Qualified Lead <ph id="ph2">\&gt;</ph> Prospect <ph id="ph3">\&gt;</ph> Contract <ph id="ph4">\&gt;</ph> Close.  At a glance, the shape of the funnel conveys the health of the process you're tracking.

Each funnel stage represents a percentage of the total. So, in most cases, a funnel chart is shaped like a funnel -- with the first stage being the largest, and each subsequent stage smaller than its predecessor.  A pear-shaped funnel is also useful -- it can identify a problem in the process.  But typically, the first stage, the "intake" stage, is the largest.

## When to use a funnel chart

Funnel charts are a great choice:

-   when the data is sequential and moves through at least 4 stages.

-   when the number of "items" in the first stage is expected to be greater than the number in the final stage.

-   to calculate potential (revenue/sales/deals/etc.) by stages.

-   to calculate and track conversion and retention rates.

-   to reveal bottlenecks in a linear process.

-   to track a shopping cart workflow.

-   to track the progress and success of click-through advertising/marketing campaigns.

## Working with funnel charts
funnel charts:

-   Can be pinned from reports and from Q&amp;A.

-   Can be sorted.

-   Support multiples.

-   Can be highlighted and cross-filtered by other visualizations on the same report page.

-   Can be used to highlight and cross-filter other visualizations on the same report page.

## Create a basic funnel chart

Now create your own funnel chart that shows the number of opportunities we have in each of our sales stages.

These instructions use the Opportunity Tracking Sample. To follow along, <bpt id="p1">[</bpt>download the sample<ept id="p1">](powerbi-sample-downloads.md)</ept>, sign in to Power BI and select <bpt id="p2">**</bpt>Get Data <ph id="ph1">\&gt;</ph> Samples <ph id="ph2">\&gt;</ph> Opportunity Analysis Sample <ph id="ph3">\&gt;</ph> Connect<ept id="p2">**</ept>.

1. Start on a <bpt id="p1">[</bpt>blank report page <ept id="p1">](powerbi-service-add-a-page-to-a-report.md)</ept>in <bpt id="p2">[</bpt>Editing View<ept id="p2">](powerbi-service-interact-with-a-report-in-editing-view.md)</ept> and select the <bpt id="p3">**</bpt>SalesStage<ept id="p3">**</ept> <ph id="ph1">\&gt;</ph> <bpt id="p4">**</bpt>Sales Stage<ept id="p4">**</ept> field.  

    ![](media/powerbi-service-tutorial-funnel-charts/FunnelSelectField_new.png)

2. <bpt id="p1">[</bpt>Convert the chart<ept id="p1">](powerbi-service-change-the-type-of-visualization-in-a-report.md)</ept> to a funnel. Notice that <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Sales Stage<ept id="p1">**</ept> is in the <bpt id="p2">**</bpt>Group<ept id="p2">**</ept> well. 

3. From the <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Fields<ept id="p1">**</ept> pane, select <bpt id="p2">**</bpt>Fact<ept id="p2">**</ept> <ph id="ph1">\&gt;</ph> <bpt id="p3">**</bpt>Opportunity Count<ept id="p3">**</ept>.

4. Hovering over a bar displays a wealth of information.

    -   The name of the stage

    -   Number of opportunities currently in this stage

    -   Overall conversion rate (% of Lead) 

    -   Stage-to-stage (aka Drop Rate) which is the % of the previous stage (in this case, Proposal Stage/Solution Stage)

5. <bpt id="p1">[</bpt>Add the Funnel as a dashboard tile<ept id="p1">](powerbi-service-dashboard-tiles.md)</ept>. 

6. <bpt id="p1">[</bpt>Save the report<ept id="p1">](powerbi-service-save-a-report.md)</ept>.

## Highlighting and cross-filtering

For information about using the Filters pane, see <bpt id="p1">[</bpt>Add a filter to a report<ept id="p1">](powerbi-service-add-a-filter-to-a-report.md)</ept>.

Highlighting a bar in a funnel cross-filters the other visualizations on the report page... and vice versa. To follow along, add a few more visuals to the report page that contains the funnel chart.

1.  On the funnel, select the <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Proposal<ept id="p1">**</ept> bar. This cross-highlights the other visualizations on the page. 

    ![](media/powerbi-service-tutorial-funnel-charts/FunnelChartNoOwl.gif)

    >[AZURE.TIP]  Use CTRL to multi-select. 

2.  In the "Factored Revenue by Opportunity" chart, highlight the <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Large<ept id="p1">**</ept> bar to cross-filter the other visualizations on the page, including the funnel chart.

3. To set preferences for how visuals cross-highlight and cross-filter each other, see <bpt id="p1">[</bpt>Visual interactions in Power BI<ept id="p1">](powerbi-service-visual-interactions.md)</ept>

## Create a funnel chart in Q&amp;A

Highlight the dashboard that has at least one visualization pinned from the "Opportunity Tracking" dataset.  When you type a question in Q&amp;A, Power BI searches for answers in all the datasets that are associated with (have tiles pinned to) the selected dashboard. For more information see, <bpt id="p1">[</bpt>Power BI - basic concepts<ept id="p1">](powerbi-service-basic-concepts.md)</ept>.

1.  Highlight a dashboard that has at least one tile pinned from the Opportunity Tracking dataset.

2.   Begin typing your question in the Q&amp;A question box.

    Be sure to add "as funnel" so Power BI knows which visualization type you'd prefer.
