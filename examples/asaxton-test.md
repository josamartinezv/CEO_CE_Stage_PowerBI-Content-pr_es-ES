# Unsupported data source for refresh

You may see an error when trying to configure a dataset for <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Scheduled Refresh<ept id="p1">**</ept>.

    You cannot schedule refresh for this dataset because it gets data from sources that currently don't support refresh.

This happens when the data source you used, within <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Power BI Desktop<ept id="p1">**</ept>, isn't supported for refresh.  You can see the list of supported data sources at <bpt id="p1">[</bpt>Refresh data in Power BI<ept id="p1">](powerbi-refresh-data.md)</ept>.
