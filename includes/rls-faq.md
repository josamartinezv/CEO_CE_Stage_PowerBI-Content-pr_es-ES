<bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Question:<ept id="p1">**</ept> What if I had previously created roles/rules for a dataset in the Power BI service? Will they still work if I do nothing?
<bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Answer:<ept id="p1">**</ept> No. Visuals will not render properly. You will have to re-create the roles/rules within Power BI Desktop and then published to the Power BI service.

<bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Question:<ept id="p1">**</ept> Can I creates these roles for Analysis Services data sources?
<bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Answer:<ept id="p1">**</ept> You can if you imported the data into Power BI Desktop. If you are using a live connection, you will not be able to configure RLS within the Power BI service. This is defined within the Analysis Services model on-premises.
