#Power BI technical content channel guidance

##aka: What goes where?
Generally speaking, core technical content for Microsoft Power BI belongs in the <bpt id="p1">[</bpt>Power BI Documentation Center<ept id="p1">](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/documentation)</ept>. Members of the content and product teams also publish developer content to <bpt id="p1">[</bpt>MSDN<ept id="p1">](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn877544.aspx)</ept>, and we publish to the <bpt id="p2">[</bpt>Power BI blog<ept id="p2">](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/powerbi/)</ept>. 

The following channels are not part of the standard Power BI technical content experience:

- <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>TechNet Library<ept id="p1">**</ept>: TechNet does not offer a Power BI branded experience. All content for all audiences goes in the branded, scoped Power BI library hosted on MSDN.
- <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>TechNet Wiki<ept id="p1">**</ept>: The wiki does not offer a Power BI branded experience. The community and internal partners can contribute to Power BI technical content through the Discus comment stream and by contributing to articles through GitHub.
- <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Standard MSDN library view<ept id="p1">**</ept>: Standard view does not offer a Power BI branded experience.
- <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>TechNet TechCenters<ept id="p1">**</ept>: Our center is published to https://powerbi.microsoft.com/developers.
- <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>MSDN DevCenters<ept id="p1">**</ept>: Our center is published to https://powerbi.microsoft.com/developers.
- <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>E-book, CSI e-book gallery<ept id="p1">**</ept>: Due to static nature of content, do not deliver content in e-book form. The vast majority of content should be published through powerbi.microsoft.com or to the Power BI scoped library.
